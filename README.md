# PublicEventsAPI
The Public Events API is a project that aims to provide a comprehensive solution for managing public events through a RESTful API. This project adheres to the SOLID principles, follows Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, and implements a RESTful approach to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations using Entity Framework Core.

Introduction
The Public Events API is designed to facilitate the management of public events. It provides a set of endpoints that allow users to perform CRUD operations on event data. This project emphasizes the use of SOLID principles, adheres to OOP practices, and implements a RESTful approach for building a scalable and maintainable API.

Features
Create new public events with relevant information.
Retrieve detailed information about existing events.
Update event details, such as date, time, location, and description.
Delete events that are no longer relevant.
SOLID Principles
The SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open-Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion) are fundamental guidelines for writing maintainable and scalable software. The Public Events API follows these principles by organizing code into modular components with clear responsibilities, minimizing code duplication, and promoting flexibility through interfaces and abstractions.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
The project is built on Object-Oriented Programming principles. It employs classes and objects to represent real-world entities such as events. Inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism are used to create a well-structured and easily extendable codebase.

RESTful Approach
The API follows a RESTful architecture, adhering to best practices for designing web services. It leverages HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on resources, and it uses meaningful URIs to represent different endpoints. This approach ensures a logical and standardized API design that is easy to understand and use.

CRUD Operations with Entity Framework Core
The Public Events API utilizes Entity Framework Core, a popular Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework, to interact with the underlying database. This enables efficient and reliable storage and retrieval of event data. The API seamlessly integrates CRUD operations using Entity Framework Core to provide a smooth experience for users.
